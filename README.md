# Unit-3

This is a repository for the middle third of the DigitalCrafts bootcamp, starting with Node.js, 
moving into Express, then into MySQL, Sequel Pro, then finally a full stack implementation.

Callback-day-3 - This directory addresses callbacks and anonymous functions, and their effectiveness
    especially when large data structures come into play.
Ian-instruction-et-al - Utilizing the callback info we learned, and applying it to back end before 
    delving into Express.
MovieApp - This is one of our first Express driven back-end websites, dealing with config, API keys, and the 
    package.json.
SQL	refactored - Another pre-Express site that links a user to the back end securely.
Vote_App - Learned about setting up users, foreign keys, and injecting sequel into our database 
    (secure against sequel injection), and work to be able to upload images into the database and
    utilize cookie parser. Mostly default Express except in back end and app.js
algorithms - exercises to address:
        1. Phone number transition, 
        2. Conversion to camel-case or snake-case based on user preference using regular
            expressions, and
        3. A function to test the type of card based on the number entered, and returns an 
            answer.
express_async_frame - One of the first exercises in Express, done to help us learn better the 
    steps to making a site using Node.js, Express, and so on.
myNPM - Worked through config, and worked on the req and res (request and result) as a precursor
    to Express as most express app.use instances work with the req and res.
myNewSite - simple express framework that allows interactivity between personal projects (in
    public directory) through simple anchor tags in the index.ejs, versus using routes, which
    was very illuminating.
node-intro-to-npm - This was our first Express driven website made, and utilized the package-lock.json
    to get all the node modules. Worked through the logic of pushing and pulling content to github in
    projects and how to use in AWS.
nodeExercises - Simple algorithms to illustrate the capability of Node.js and the require aspect of
    connecting files. Also, addresses interacting with programs on command line as a rudimentary way
    of showing how the back end functions
promises - First introduction to asynchronous functions and why they're needed in Node.js, as wel as 
    JavaScript.
